      <h2>This test examines the alleles of certain genes assosciated with Alzheimer's. Certain genes, such as Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), prenesilin 1, and prenesilin 2 guarantee that a patient will develop Alzheimer's, and increase risk of early onset. However, these genes account for fewer than 1% of cases; other mutations that increase the risk but do not guarantee that Alhzeimer's will develop are far more common. The most reliable such allele is APOE &epsilon;4, but other genes such as BIN1, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 are also tested. In addition, certain alleles can offer protection from Alzheimer's: while APOE &epsilon;4 increases risk, APOE &epsilon;2 reduces it.</h2>
