      <h2>The algorithm used to combine this data is one of the most important pieces. Each test alone can miss some cases or diagnose Alzheimerâ€™s where there is none. However, when the tests are taken to together it is far less likely to err. The algorithm would return a probability of developing AD and its various symptoms, for example 56% of patients with similar test results had trouble living unassisted 10 years later, so you have a 56% &plusmn; 5% chance of developing similar symptoms, with the 5% error determined by the accuracy of the algorithm in the real world.</h2>
