        Once neurodegeneration occurs, the damge is irreversable, so why would you wait until there are behavioral changes to diagnose Alzheimer&apos;s?

        %h3.text.normal.align.left For a cheap and noninvasive look at conditions inside the brain, the eye exam is a valuable first tool. We examine multiple factors that could betray brain damage, such as retinal thickness, plaques, and vascular structure.

        %h3.text.normal.align.left This test measures levels of three proteins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF test, while more invasive, is more accurate, while the blood test is easy and cheap to administer.
