      <h2>Both tests measure the concentration of three proteins: beta amyloid, tau protein, and a specific type of tau closely assosciated with neurofibrillary tangles called phosphorylated tau (P-tau). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta amyloid decrease as more beta amyloid is deposited in plaques, and levels of tau and P-tau increase as neurons die and neurofibrillary tangles form. Blood levels should follow a similar pattern. The blood test, while less accurate, is cheap and noninvasive compared to the spinal tap required for CSF. The blood test can be given more frequently and the CSF test given as needed.</h2>

      <h2>Regardless of bodily fluid being used, the protein concentration is measured using an immunoassay. In an immunoassya, antibodies that bind specifically to the protein of interest are attached to a plastic well, and the blood or CSF is added. Once the proteins bind to the antibodies, more antibodies are added that also are bound to an enzyme on their other end. These antibodies bind to the other end of the protein of interest, forming a “sandwich” of antibodies with the protein in the middle, and the enzyme sticking off the end of the antibody. Now another enzyme can be added, one that causes the enzyme on the antibody to change in color, for example. To detect multiple proteins, different types of indicators that change different colors bind to different proteins.</h2>
